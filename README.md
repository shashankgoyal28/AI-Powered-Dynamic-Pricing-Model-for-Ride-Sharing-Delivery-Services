RideShare Pricing Analysis and Prediction - Case Study

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting rideshare prices for services like Uber and Lyft using advanced data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and multiple regression models. The aim is to build a robust predictive model that minimizes error and accurately forecasts rideshare prices based on various features like time of day, cab type, and weather conditions.

Key Objectives
	•	Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical features.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize patterns and relationships between features and target variables.
	•	Feature Engineering: Apply encoding and scaling techniques to prepare the dataset for machine learning models.
	•	Model Training and Evaluation: Implement and evaluate multiple regression models using metrics like R², MAE, and RMSE.

Project Structure
	•	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Dropping unnecessary columns (e.g., id, timestamp).
	•	Handling missing values by imputing with the mean for the price column.
	•	Encoding categorical variables using OneHotEncoder.
	•	Standardizing numerical features using StandardScaler.
	•	EDA:
	•	Visualizations to explore trends in pricing across hours, cab types, and locations.
	•	Correlation heatmaps for feature selection.
	•	Boxplots and scatter plots for outlier detection and understanding feature-target relationships.
	•	Model Training:
Multiple regression models were implemented and evaluated:
	•	Linear Regression
	•	Ridge Regression
	•	Lasso Regression
	•	SGDRegressor
	•	ElasticNet Regression
	•	Evaluation Metrics:
	•	R² Score: To measure the variance explained by the model.
	•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices.
	•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of the average squared errors.

Results

The predictive models were evaluated, and key metrics (R², MAE, RMSE) were calculated to compare performance. Linear regression showed promising results, while regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso improved generalization.

Future Scope
	•	Integrate real-time data from rideshare APIs.
	•	Expand feature engineering to include weather conditions and traffic data.
	•	Apply more advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
